ðŸ’» My portfolio is created in React 17.0.2.  It's continuously evolving with me on my coding journey!  

I have a passion bringing the technical and creative aspects of web development to each project. I work to bridge these together thereby creating a user experience to the design. Connecting and interacting with a website encourages more community engagement.

I am happiest when creating, learning, and exploring how to bring websites to life. My experience managing systems, networks, and IT administration puts me in a unique position to troubleshoot and solve problems on my coding journey.
